## Build Instructions
This project was made with Unity 5.3

1. Create a new project in Unity
1. Unzip in the project folder
1. Load the Scenes/Game2.unity scene


## Known bugs
* Half the Nucleobase letters have their rotation wrong
* Score is kinda meaningless, it should punish you more when you make mutations
* Score is missing sounds for good and bad move. The code is there and ready for it though.
* Starting the Standalone player in fullscreen messes everything up. Although you can start in windowed mode and alt-enter to switch to fullscreen.
* There's no way to get out of the GameOver screen (You'll have to ALT-F4 in Windows or refresh the page in your browser)


Thank you for trying the game and leaving comments, it's much appreciated!
